### This Repo Implements algorithms , (mainly) in python, related to first encounters when learning algorithms and data structures, a good portion of these implementations used the book `Introduction to Algorithms from Thomas H. Cormen` as theoretical material

### Some examples that include dynamic programming, divide and conquer, greedy:
* Longest Increasing Subsequence (lis.py)
* Longest Common Subsequence (lcs.py)
* KMP Algorithm (kmp.py)
* Quicksort (quicksort.py)
* String enconding (huffman.py)
